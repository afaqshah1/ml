MLModels.py provides implementation of different ML algortihms using scikit learn and compares their perfromance.
k-fold demo.py demonstrates 10-fold usage in machine learning
These codes were developed as part of machine learning training conducted by the developer.

This code is written by Dr Syed Afaq Ali Shah to demonstrate the performance of different machine learning techniques
Syed is a computer scientist by profession and founder of Intelligaroo (www.intelligaroo.com)

Prerequisites - Python and scikit learn installation required
The code is well commented.
Models tested include: Linear regression, Ridge regression, Naive Bayes Classifier, Decision Tree, Bagging,
Adaboost, Random Forest and Artificial Neural Network

Training and testing has been done on digits datasets which is available in scikit learn library.
